;; Perform the transitive closure of the graph. This is the most challenging 
;; operation in the project, so we recommend putting it off until the end.
;; 
;; To perform the transitive closure of the graph, iteratively add links
;; whenever you find a matching (x,y) and (y,z). This can be done in one of 
;; two broad ways: (a) chaotic iteration or (b) semi-naive evaluation. 
;; Read the project description for more details and hints at a solution.
;; 
;; My solution uses `foldl`, `hash-keys`, `set->list`, `hash-ref`, and 
;; `add-link`. It is always possible to use a recursive helper function instead
;; of a foldl, but it makes the code much easier to understand in my opinion.
